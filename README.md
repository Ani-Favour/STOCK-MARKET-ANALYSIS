# STOCK-MARKET-ANALYSIS
This project presents an in-depth SQL-based analysis of historical stock market data from the S&amp;P 500 between 2014 and 2017. Using Microsoft SQL Server, I explored key market metrics, volatility trends, trading volumes, and performance insights across multiple dimensions â€” including time, stock symbols, and price movement patterns.

## Temporal Patterns:
- **Which day of the week sees the highest average close prices across the market?**
```SQL
SELECT 
DATENAME(WEEKDAY, [date]) AS day_of_week,
AVG([close]) AS avg_close_price
FROM [S&P_500_Stock Prices_2014-2017]
GROUP BY DATENAME(WEEKDAY, date)
ORDER BY avg_close_price DESC
```
|day_of_week |	avg_close_price |
|--------- |------------- |
|Friday|	86.51 |
|Wednesday|	86.42 |
|Thursday|	86.32 |
|Monday |	86.32 |
|Tuesday |	86.27 |

- **How do monthly average closing prices for a stock trend over time?**
 ```SQL
Alter table [S&P_500_Stock Prices_2014-2017]
 Add [Month] Varchar(50)

 Update [S&P_500_Stock Prices_2014-2017]
 Set [Month] = Datename(Month, [date])


SELECT [Month],
AVG([close]) AS avg_close_price
FROM [S&P_500_Stock Prices_2014-2017]
WHERE symbol = 'ABBV'
GROUP BY [Month]
ORDER BY 
    Case [Month]	
		WHEN 'January' THEN 1
        WHEN 'February' THEN 2
        WHEN 'March' THEN 3
        WHEN 'April' THEN 4
        WHEN 'May' THEN 5
        WHEN 'June' THEN 6
        WHEN 'July' THEN 7
        WHEN 'August' THEN 8
        WHEN 'September' THEN 9
        WHEN 'October' THEN 10
        WHEN 'November' THEN 11
        WHEN 'December' THEN 12
    END
```
|Month |	avg_close_price |
|----- | ------------- |
|January |	57.89 |
|February |	56.12 |
|March |	58.11 |
|April |	59.03 |
|May |	61.56 |
|June |	63.70 |
|July |	65.03 |
|August |	64.93 |
|September |	66.06 |
|October |	66.23 |
|November |	70.47 |

## Pattern Recognition:
- **Identified bullish trading patterns (close > open)**
```SQL
SELECT symbol,
COUNT(*) AS Bullish_Days
FROM [S&P_500_Stock Prices_2014-2017]
WHERE [close] > [open]
GROUP BY symbol
ORDER BY Bullish_Days DESC
```
|symbol |	Bullish_Days |
|------ | ----------- |
|INTU	|578 |
|ADBE	|577 |
|RMD	|571 |
|SNPS	|568 |
|IDXX	|563 |
