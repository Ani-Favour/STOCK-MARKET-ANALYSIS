# STOCK-MARKET-ANALYSIS
This project presents an in-depth SQL-based analysis of historical stock market data from the S&amp;P 500 between 2014 and 2017. Using Microsoft SQL Server, I explored key market metrics, volatility trends, trading volumes, and performance insights across multiple dimensions â€” including time, stock symbols, and price movement patterns.
